# neuroXplorer

**neuroXplorer** is a set of tools and programs that explicitly displays and compares various watershed programs. 

## Getting Started & Documentation

neuroXplorer contains a set of jupyter notebook files which contains in-house documentation for our main two programs. 

## Quick Guide

Run the `save_data_to_file.py` and the `save_ground_to_file.py` files using python 2.7. This will output two .npy files: `nXp_data.py` and `nXp_ground.npy` respectively. After those files have appeared, run `nXp-analysis.py` and a new file `results.txt` will appear in your working directory. 

You may also run `gala_shed.py` to view the gala watershed result also.
